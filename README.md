# Fullstack Clothing Web Store

https://theory-climbing.vercel.app/

I have built a website with Next.js and TypeScript to create a platform for climbing-related clothing for myself and my friends. As a computer science student at the University of North Texas, this project was a fantastic opportunity for me to dive deeper into these technologies and apply what Iâ€™m learning in a real-world scenario.
